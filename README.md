# README

This program takes the user through a set of questions that must be answered within a time limit that begins once the user clicks to start the quiz.

The key things that are noted in this program are: 

* There is a high score page that can be accessed at any point during the quiz 

* The questions will render after a user answers a question and if a question is answered correctly, you'll hear a positive reinforcement sound, otherwise, you'll hear a 'wrong answer' sound

* For every wrong answer entered, the user receives a time penalty of 10 seconds 

* At the end of the quiz, the user receives a final score and the program alerts the user how many questions were answered correctly

* Finally, the user is then prompted to enter their initials to be entered into a high score page
